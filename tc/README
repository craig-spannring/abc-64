termcap - terminal capabilities, library and database.

The routines provided by the library 'libtermcap.a' extract and use
capabilities from the terminal database 'termcap'.

It is included in the Mark 2 distribution of ABC because the ABC editor
uses it, it is in the public domain, and there are UNIXes without it.
If '../Setup' finds the termcap in your system it uses that one.

If you don't have termcap available on your system the best thing to do
is to install it and run ../Setup again.

	make DEST=/usr/lib ETC=/etc install

will install the library and database at their usual places.  If these
are different on your system you will probably have to change pathnames
in the sources too. The files tc?.c test out the library routines.
Don't forget to copy the manual pages from termcap.3X and termcap.5
to your systems manual.

For more information consult those manual pages.

For any program to work with termcap, the user should set the $TERM and
$TERMCAP environment variables in her profile. You can also install
abc and abckeys as shell scripts, calling the executable binaries after
setting these, e.g. for abc:
	
	: set TERMCAP environment variable
	: ${TERMCAP=$ABC_LIB/termcap}
	export TERMCAP
	exec /usr/new/lib/abc/abc.exe

if the latter is the name you gave the binary.
