When you enter `abc -e' and enters your favorite editor (in my case `vi'),
the terminal is not left in a completely sane state (I suspect that at least
the LF -> CR/LF translation is not reset).

The on-line Unix manual don't know how to deal with `.IR'-macros.

Mac: initial editor error message is misplaced on the screen

All: THe BTrees modules doesn't work on 64 bit systems
