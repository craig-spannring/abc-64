The purpose of this directory is to generate the grammar tables for
the ABC editor in ../bed/e1tabl.c and ../ehdrs/tabl.h from a more or
less readable description in ./grammar.abc (also using ./lang.h).

The ABC system is set up such that you can do without this directory.

However, if you want to make a version of ABC with KEYWORDS in another
language, you only need to change ./lang.h and say 'make install' here.
(You might have to change the name of the C preprocessor in the Makefile.)
This will install new versions of ../bed/e1tabl.c and ../ehdrs/tabl.h,
incorporating the new grammar info.
You should also change ../bhdrs/b0lan.h and bint2/i2dis.c 
for the ABC interpreter.
Then you can 'cd ..' and remake the ABC system.

Likewise if for whatever reason you only change the grammar file,
it is sufficient to say 'make install' here, and remake in '..'.

The ABC grammar is in the file grammar.abc.
The format of this file is decribed in its heading.

The rest of the files here (together with some files from elsewhere in
the ABC system) are sources for the program 'mktable' that generates the
include- and data-file.
If you change anything in them you might have to recreate the
dependencies in the Makefile with 'make -f Makefile.bsd Makefile'.
See ../Makefile.unix, ../scripts/mkdep and ../Problems if your system cannot
cope with the BSD-ism 'cc -M' for generating dependency info for make.
