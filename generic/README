This directory 'generic' contains a skeleton version of the routines
in the ABC implementation that we consider non-portable between
different operating systems. Apart from this directory you will need
the editor- and interpreter directories mentioned in ../doc/Structure.

The file ./PORTING.DOC contains a guide for adapting the routines to your
operating system.

If your system has a 'make'-like utility for maintaining computer programs,
the template ./Makefile might be helpfull to get started with. If not,
it still can serve as a guide to the files needed, and the steps to be taken.

Good Luck!
