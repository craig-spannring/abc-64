Description:

ABC is a programming language and environment for personal computing
designed and implemented at the CWI.
We have tried to combine attractive features in existing systems
with some ideas of our own.

Some features of the ABC programming language are:
 * a powerful collection of only five different data types
   that may easily be combined;
 * strong typing, yet without declarations;
 * no limitations, apart from sheer exhaustion of memory;
 * refinements to support top-down programming;
 * nesting by indentation.

Some features of the ABC environment are:
 * no need for files; how-to's (procedures and functions) and global
   variables remain after logging out;
 * one consistent face is shown to the user at all times,
   whether she executes commands, edits how-to's, or enters input to
   a program;
 * generalized undo mechanism.
