The subdirectories here represent ABC workspaces, with example ABC how-to's.

With DoExamples, the ABC interpreter in .. is tested (via the shell
command '../abc') on the following four examples:

	generate	generates new sentences based on those supplied
			by the user;
	hanoi		the towers of hanoi;
	pi		calculates the value of pi, using the unbounded
			arithmetic of ABC;
	xref		a cross reference generator.

For more information on these programs, see the B Newsletter, Issue 2.

The ABC editor can only be tested by calling ../abc interactively, as
is done by TryEditor.
For this the 'try' workspace has been created from the 'generate' example,
so you can always regenerate it with:

        cd  ./generate
        cp  *  ../try

The file ../EDITOR tells you how to try the ABC editor.
