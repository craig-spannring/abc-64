FAULTY PROGRAM: abc

DESCRIPTION OF FAULT:
        if '~/abc' are shared between both UNIX and MSDOS a prolem occurs.
        MSDOS replaces 'LF' created by UNIX with 'CRLF' so that UNIX can't read 
'~/abc'
        any more without converting them back to UNIX 'LF' end-of-line-character
(s).

FIX:
        let unix ignore any 'CR' while reading files.

Issue new version with floorf replaced with floor_f
